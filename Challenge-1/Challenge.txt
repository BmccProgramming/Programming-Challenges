Tier 1:

	Create a program that takes in a string and outputs the reverse.
Don’t use any pre-built modules(methods). ex. “Hello world” → “olleH dlrow”

Tier 2:

	Add a piglatin method to turn the words into piglatin.To do this move the first letter or the word to the
	end of the word, then add "ay" at the end.
	ex.
		"pig" = "igpay"
		"latin" = "atinlay"
		"banana" = "ananabay"
