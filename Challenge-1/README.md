##Tier 1:
    Create a program that takes in a string and outputs the reverse.
    Don’t use any pre-built modules(methods). ex. “Hello world” → “olleH dlrow”

##Tier 2:

    Add a pig-latin method to turn the words into pig latin.To do this move the first letter or the word to the end of the word, then add "ay" at the end.
    ex.
        "pig" = "igpay"
        "latin" = "atinlay"
        "banana" = "ananabay"


###Answer:
    The methods for both tier 1 and 2 are posted inside the Main.java
    To test these methods change the userInput field.

    note: This is a simple implementation is meant to be simple.
